# Machine Learning Assignment: KNN vs Decision Tree

I am thrilled to share my latest project: **Comparative Study of KNN and Decision Tree Models for Predicting Students' Adaptability in Online Education**!

This project involves a detailed analysis of two popular machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree, to predict students' adaptability levels in an online education environment.

## Objective

The primary goal is to understand which model performs better in predicting the adaptability of students in an online education setting, based on various performance metrics.

## Key Insights

### Data Profiling

- **Dataset Overview**: The dataset contains information about students' demographics, education background, and their responses related to online learning.
- **Key Features**: Age, Gender, Education Level, and several other attributes that potentially influence adaptability.

### Model Comparison

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Accuracy**: 0.9
- **Precision**: 0.93
- **Recall**: 0.93
- **F1-Score**: 0.92

#### Decision Tree

- **Accuracy**: 1.0
- **Precision**: 1.0
- **Recall**: 1.0
- **F1-Score**: 1.0

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the Decision Tree model outperforms the K-Nearest Neighbors model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. While the Decision Tree model achieved perfect scores in all metrics, indicating it perfectly classified the data without errors, the KNN model also performed well but not to the same degree.

This suggests that for this specific dataset and problem of predicting students' adaptability in online education, the Decision Tree model is more suitable. It provides a clear advantage in terms of classification performance, making it a better choice for applications where precise and reliable predictions are crucial.
