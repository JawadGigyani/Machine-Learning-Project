# Machine Learning Assignment: KNN vs Decision Tree

I am thrilled to share my latest project: **Comparative Study of KNN and Decision Tree Models for Predicting Students' Adaptability in Online Education**!

This project involves a detailed analysis of two popular machine learning algorithms, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree, to predict students' adaptability levels in an online education environment.

## Objective

The primary goal is to understand which model performs better in predicting the adaptability of students in an online education setting, based on various performance metrics.

## Key Insights

### Data Profiling

- **Dataset Overview**: The dataset contains information about students' demographics, education background, and their responses related to online learning.
- **Key Features**: Age, Gender, Education Level, and several other attributes that potentially influence adaptability.

### Model Comparison

#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Accuracy**: 0.9
- **Precision**: 0.93
- **Recall**: 0.93
- **F1-Score**: 0.92

#### Decision Tree

- **Accuracy**: 1.0
- **Precision**: 1.0
- **Recall**: 1.0
- **F1-Score**: 1.0

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the [better-performing model] outperforms the other in terms of [specific metrics]. This suggests that [brief conclusion about the performance and suitability of the models].
